Bug 1
Line 310:
	Original: manager.updateStudentId(id, newid);
	Buggy: manager.updateStudentId(newid, id);
	Causes program to fail to update student id
	
Bug 2	
Line 96: 
	Original: studentDatabase.push_back(Student(temp_name, temp_id, temp_email, gpre, gp, ge));
	Buggy: studentDatabase.push_back(Student(temp_name, temp_id, temp_email, gpre, ge, gp));
	Causes program to assign student project grades as essay grades and vice versa when reading from data file

Bug 3
Line 334:
	Original: else
	Buggy: else if (choice > 7)
	Causes program to enter an infinite loop if the value entered is not an integer greater than 0
	
Bug 4
Line 257:
	Original: iss >> name >> id >> email >> gpre >> ge >> gpro
	Buggy: cin >> name >> id >> email >> gpre >> ge >> gpro
	Causes program to continuously ask for input 
	
Bug 5
Line 149:
	Original: for (vector<Student>::iterator it = studentDatabase.begin(); it != studentDatabase.end(); ++it) {
	Buggy: for (vector<Student>::iterator it = studentDatabase.begin(); it == studentDatabase.end(); ++it) {
	Makes it impossible to search for student by email because program fails to iterate through database 
	
Bug 6
	~ line 323 TUI(){}
	Original: uses file_exists() method to ensure the file was created
	Buggy: no check exists so bad file path can result in new student addition causing seg fault since studentDatabase will be empty 

Bug 7
	~ 149 writeStudentData()
	Original: uses file_exists() method to ensure the file was created
	Buggy: no check exists so bad file path results in no actual output file

Bug 8
	~ 373 (choice == 2)
	Original: uses spacecount() to check number of spaces in input string and rejects user input for retry if there are < 5 or > 5 spaces : not the right number of data fields
	Buggy: inconsitent record fields since any input length will result in some form of record

Bug 9
	~ 164 addStudent()
	Original: check studentDatabase to see if the ID exists and does not add record if it does - ID's are unique.
	Buggy: No check therefore several records can have the same ID

Bug 10
	~ 263 (choice == 3)
	Original: Initialize character array id
	Buggy: No initialization which can cause a segmentation fault for lack of memory allocation

Bug 11 ~373 (choice == 2)
	Original: Data validation for presentation, essay and project grades
	Buggy: No validation of the grades and therefore anything can be inputted
